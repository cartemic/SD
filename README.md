# SD2: A SDToolbox fork for python <img src="https://travis-ci.org/cartemic/SD2.svg?branch=master">
I am working on making Caltech's SDToolbox more readable, PEP 8 compliant, and python 3 compatible, as well as adding in unit tests. I will be using this package for use in my doctoral research project involving gaseous detonations, in conjunction with <a href="https://github.com/cartemic/BeaverDet">BeaverDet</a> (currently under development). Where possible, I am replacing their functions with numpy and scipy equivalents. So far this has improved CJ speed calculation time by ~20%.
