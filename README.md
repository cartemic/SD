# SD2: A SDToolbox fork for python <img src="https://travis-ci.org/cartemic/SD2.svg?branch=master">

This package is a modified fork of [SDToolbox](http://shepherd.caltech.edu/EDL/public/cantera/html/SD_Toolbox/), and all credit for the original functions goes to the researchers in Caltech's [Explosion Dynamics Laboratory](http://shepherd.caltech.edu/EDL/). The functions in this package have been modified and moved around with the intent of making the package faster, more readable, PEP 8 compliant, and deployable using pip/conda.
